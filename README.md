# Reverse Mortgage Simulator Project

## Made By:

Tom√°s Cordoba

Emmanuel Calad 

## Purpose

Its purpose is to provide an accessible and easy-to-use tool that allows users to thoroughly and accurately evaluate the options available in the reverse mortgage market. This software is designed to help older homeowners understand how this type of financial product works, estimate the potential amount of funds they could receive, and visualize the impact a reverse mortgage would have on their financial situation over time. The simulator offers an interactive simulation based on custom data, allowing users to adjust key variables such as property value, interest rate and loan duration.

## How does it work?

The user must enter certain personal data (age, gender, marital status, age of their spouse (optional) and gender of their spouse (optional)).
Additionally, you must enter information related to your home and the financing (value and interest rate).

Subsequently, the system will be in charge of carrying out the necessary calculations and will return the value of each monthly installment of the reverse mortgage.

## How is it done?

The project is divided into two main folders, an src folder and a tests folder. The src folder contains a module in which there is a file with the distribution of the classes and methods, and another is the module in which the execution of the program by console is found. On the other hand, the tests folder contains each of the unit tests (normal cases, extraordinary cases and error cases). In addition, there are 3 files of the general structure of a project (.gitignore, README.MD and License).
